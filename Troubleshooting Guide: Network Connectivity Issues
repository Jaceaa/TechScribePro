# Troubleshooting Guide: Network Connectivity Issues

## Overview  
This guide provides step-by-step troubleshooting instructions for diagnosing and resolving network connectivity issues on company workstations.

## Symptoms  
- No internet access  
- Slow or intermittent connection  
- Cannot reach internal resources  
- DNS resolution failures  

## Prerequisites  
- Verify the workstation is powered on and connected to the network  
- Ensure no scheduled maintenance is affecting the network  

## Step-by-Step Troubleshooting  

### **Step 1: Check Physical Connections**  
1. Ensure the Ethernet cable is securely plugged in (if applicable).  
2. If using Wi-Fi, confirm the workstation is connected to the correct network.  
3. Restart the router/switch if multiple devices are affected.  

### **Step 2: Verify IP Configuration**  
#### **Windows:**  
Run the following command in Command Prompt:
```sh
ipconfig /all
```
- If no IP address is assigned, release and renew with:
```sh
ipconfig /release && ipconfig /renew
```

#### **Linux/macOS:**  
Check the IP address:
```sh
ifconfig (or ip a)
```
Renew the IP address:
```sh
sudo dhclient -r && sudo dhclient
```

### **Step 3: Test Network Connectivity**  
#### **Ping Gateway:**  
```sh
ping -c 4 <gateway_ip>
```
If no response, proceed to Step 4.  

#### **Ping External Address (Google DNS - 8.8.8.8):**  
```sh
ping -c 4 8.8.8.8
```
If successful, but websites don't load, there may be a DNS issue. Move to Step 5.  

### **Step 4: Restart Network Services**  
#### **Windows:**  
```sh
netsh int ip reset
netsh winsock reset
ipconfig /flushdns
```

#### **Linux/macOS:**  
```sh
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
```

### **Step 5: Check DNS Resolution**  
Test DNS with:
```sh
nslookup google.com
```
If it fails, change DNS settings to Google's public DNS:  
- **Windows:** Update DNS in network adapter settings.  
- **Linux/macOS:** Edit `/etc/resolv.conf` and add:
```sh
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
```

### **Step 6: Check Firewall and Security Software**  
1. Temporarily disable firewall/antivirus and test connectivity.  
2. If disabling resolves the issue, update firewall rules to allow network traffic.  

### **Step 7: Contact IT Support**  
If the issue persists, collect the following information before escalating:
- Output from `ipconfig /all` (Windows) or `ifconfig/ip a` (Linux/macOS)  
- Ping results to gateway and external IPs  
- Any recent changes to network configuration  

## Conclusion  
Following this guide will resolve most network connectivity issues. If further assistance is required, escalate the issue to IT support with the collected diagnostics.
