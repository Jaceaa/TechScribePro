Log Analysis for Security Incident Detection
Objective
This guide outlines the step-by-step process for analyzing security logs to detect and respond to potential security incidents.

Step 1: Accessing Log Files
Identify relevant log sources:

Windows Event Logs (Event Viewer > Security Logs)
Linux Logs (/var/log/syslog, /var/log/auth.log)
Firewall and Network Logs (SIEM tools like Splunk, Graylog)
Use command-line tools to view logs:

Windows: wevtutil qe Security /c:10 /rd:true /f:text
Linux: tail -f /var/log/auth.log
Step 2: Identifying Suspicious Activity
Look for unusual login attempts:

Repeated failed logins (Event ID 4625 in Windows)
Successful logins from unexpected locations
SSH brute force attempts (Failed password for user in Linux logs)
Detect privilege escalation:

Windows: Event ID 4673 (Sensitive Privilege Use)
Linux: sudo activity in /var/log/auth.log
Check for malicious process execution:

Windows: Event ID 4688 (New Process Creation)
Linux: Unusual processes (ps aux | grep suspicious_process)
Step 3: Investigating and Responding
Correlate log entries across multiple sources.
Isolate the affected system if suspicious activity is confirmed.
Run forensic analysis using tools like Wireshark or Sysmon.
Report findings and escalate as needed.
Best Practices for Log Analysis
✔ Enable centralized logging to streamline analysis.
✔ Automate alerts for critical security events.
✔ Regularly review logs to establish a baseline of normal activity.
